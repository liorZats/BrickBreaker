# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker is a twist on the classic arcade game Breakout, where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. Each brick in the game features a unique collision strategy. The player starts with 3 lives, losing one if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. If all lives are lost, the game is over.
