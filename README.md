# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker is a twist on the classic arcade game Breakout, where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. Each brick in the game features a unique collision strategy. The player starts with 3 lives, losing one if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. If all lives are lost, the game is over.

# Rules
  -The player begins with three lives, a main ball, and a paddle.<br/>
  -Use the main paddle to bounce the main ball and break bricks.<br/>
  -Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.<br/>
  -Losing a life happens when the ball falls below the paddle.<br/> 
  -Extra lives are earned by destroying bricks with a heart strategy and catching the falling hearts with the main paddle.<br/>
  -Certain bricks provide an extra paddle, focus the camera on the ball, and spawn two additional puck balls.<br/>
  -To complete the game, the player must break all bricks without losing all lives.<br/>
